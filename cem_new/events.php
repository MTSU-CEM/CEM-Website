<p >We’re starting our third year of the ELL Collaborative @ MTSU, offering professional development for educators who work with English Learners – ESL teachers, general education teachers, administrators, coordinators, directors in schools and districts in Tennessee.  The ELL Collaborative is part of a broader professional development initiative known as the PK-12 Collaborative @ MTSU. It is sponsored by the Center for Educational Media and Professional Development in MTSU’s College of Education. We hold Collaborative meetings during the school year, as well as a summer conference, the ELL Collaborative Summer Academy.  We schedule our school year sessions to consider school schedules, holidays and testing.  To date, more than 300 educators from 40+ school districts in Tennessee have participated in the ELL Collaborative meetings and summer conferences.
</p>

<h3>The ELL Collaborative</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Is participant-driven, with educators identifying the topics of sessions based on their needs</li>
    <li>Is collaborative with participants serving as presenters to share strategies, materials, programs, technology that have been successful for them</li>
    <li>Is especially beneficial for districts with fewer resources and staff to support English Learners</li>
    <li>Promotes professional support networks and individual contacts across districts which is beneficial for districts with a small staff of ELL educators</li>
    <li>Offers multiple sessions throughout the school year to address topics and apply PD immediately in the classroom settings</li>
    <li>Is available at no charge to the participants (other than providing your own lunch that day!)</li>
</ul>
